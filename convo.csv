Wyatt,why is it constantly airing,1680194320.5285916,12:38:40
Wyatt,okay we're going to see,1680194480.9159646,12:41:20

Wyatt,i just want to get,1680194669.5091124,12:44:29
Wyatt,not quite sure why it's cutting in on,1680194683.1509652,12:44:43
Wyatt,okay i'm i see how this does here,1680194714.4700713,12:45:14
NaN,okay we're going to try this to see how this works,1680194918.0501628,12:48:38
NaN,good good,1680194940.403429,12:49:00
Wyatt,much better to see non then not the now what am i,1680194941.4971123,12:49:01
Wyatt,okay let's see how this works,1680195003.0439708,12:50:03
0,yeah we need to control whether it's cutting stop all for naught,1680195025.9174626,12:50:25
0,have a thick and pipe for a part of that,1680195027.3825665,12:50:27
unknown,right so we're testing this out seeing how this runs,1680195165.7190864,12:52:45
unknown,and that's the basic idea of it,1680195188.5103247,12:53:08
Wyatt,it,1680198272.767132,13:44:32
Lucas,bad bad bad bad bad bad out and than that,1680198299.259549,13:44:59
Wyatt,okay but seriously gonna actually check to see if we're getting thing right now,1680198300.3401074,13:45:00
speaker3.0,art now,1680198322.707822,13:45:22
speaker4.0,sneak wasn't frickin unknown,1680198323.6395772,13:45:23
speaker3.0,okay let's see if this now come okay or not,1680198367.459295,13:46:07
speaker3.0,before you knew the power of lot more,1680198506.0365794,13:48:26
Wyatt,right checking this out,1680198682.837885,13:51:22
speaker3.0,i knew,1680198699.1904707,13:51:39
Wyatt,okay testing this out,1680198797.8108962,13:53:17
Wyatt,aren't let's see how this works see if we get a better are right up where all this,1680198898.8025212,13:54:58
Wyatt,if we're going to see how this does not actually recording voice and all that fun stuff,1680198966.2269826,13:56:06
Wyatt,aren't we're going to see how this does is far from boarding a fair amount of,1680199095.7568293,13:58:15
Wyatt,and then we're going to see here,1680199118.666443,13:58:38
Wyatt,if it's working for a second time or not,1680199119.9436088,13:58:39
Wyatt,okay so where where up and running now,1680199273.5022972,14:01:13
speaker5.0,chief,1680200778.9467168,14:26:18
Lucas,with his in,1680200780.033504,14:26:20
speaker4.0,up,1680200825.345129,14:27:05
speaker1.0,there,1680200848.9794486,14:27:28
speaker3.0,so,1680200959.548223,14:29:19
speaker3.0,oh that's just my,1680201009.5563154,14:30:09
speaker3.0,that,1680201055.7180612,14:30:55
speaker5.0,yeah,1680201215.3755994,14:33:35
speaker3.0,the,1680201576.927832,14:39:36
speaker3.0,yeah,1680201687.7866538,14:41:27
Wyatt,change system to system,1680201688.5946395,14:41:28
speaker3.0,i've noted,1680201689.1218965,14:41:29
speaker4.0,oh,1680201779.90887,14:42:59
Lucas,there's no way to assure that,1680201940.6831875,14:45:40
speaker4.0,the,1680201941.509681,14:45:41
Wyatt,there was,1680202057.3182416,14:47:37
Wyatt,as well,1680202126.3646977,14:48:46
speaker3.0,you,1680202242.246517,14:50:42
Wyatt,this,1680202289.9566228,14:51:29
speaker3.0,you get up,1680202404.599398,14:53:24
Wyatt,hectic but at funny but sure sure sure that that's cool,1680202638.456338,14:57:18
speaker3.0,well i just saw the micron light up so my microphone might not have actually picked it up,1680203655.5126038,15:14:15
speaker4.0,the very beginning while see him yeah yeah okay,1680203656.9112127,15:14:16
speaker5.0,running at that point,1680203657.756097,15:14:17
speaker3.0,yeah this is a different,1680203680.6264515,15:14:40
Wyatt,the and room the echoing will pass the add the trying to ship but,1680203681.7524695,15:14:41
speaker3.0,near the this is just i know if it can't predict will say like speaker,1680203683.6404896,15:14:43
speaker3.0,the,1680203706.4247248,15:15:06
Wyatt,this with,1680203707.0722404,15:15:07
speaker4.0,like at that time it detected,1680203707.9933662,15:15:07
speaker5.0,wow and one speaking,1680203708.9785001,15:15:08
Lucas,interesting though because the,1680203709.8340185,15:15:09
speaker3.0,year bottom with the tax each time it's a their tactics you speaking interesting though because,1680203734.9550023,15:15:34
speaker4.0,oh sit down remembered from the last time we do this or what,1680203741.1923847,15:15:41
speaker3.0,yet the so what i actually have ah is you can,1680203742.315479,15:15:42
speaker3.0,those are the things are judging if if we're the ones actually talking so stoked for yeah yeah yeah yeah and so what what what would actually need to be happen here is than as these are selected it's gonna go back and add those are,1680203767.0332847,15:16:07
Wyatt,it it saving all sound files the conversation eight hundred the taxes since it's say beyond here and there have this is an id into sending that aggie over to here,1680203790.8355424,15:16:30
speaker3.0,yeah a what much you and the you i'd have a year,1680203813.7027702,15:16:53
speaker4.0,the the me that the is that's the only things were going up bottom,1680203814.9056225,15:16:54
speaker3.0,beat yeah so me up with only with only two sound,1680203816.0016742,15:16:55
Wyatt,i got know nose just training all my little laptop where did the recordings i tried to match those to this the microphones are two different it wouldn't match my voice,1680203839.8577678,15:17:19
speaker3.0,that but i mean it really matter as,1680203841.1348119,15:17:21
speaker4.0,meant to be used on a machine ah,1680203841.9809933,15:17:21
speaker3.0,yeah and then i believe,1680203842.6098506,15:17:22
speaker5.0,that,1680203842.9697387,15:17:22
speaker4.0,so we would have to do obviously some kind of thing to keep it from going outside of the,1680203866.1645427,15:17:46
speaker5.0,the size of yeah yeah in you set up somewhere grab,1680203867.3658123,15:17:47
speaker4.0,around,1680203867.717753,15:17:47
speaker3.0,it it is this not really this is moving slow the,1680203890.4576244,15:18:10
speaker3.0,the taken it's kind of process your these so,1680203935.1791372,15:18:55
speaker4.0,and i'll give an example of to,1680203936.4324923,15:18:56
Wyatt,yeah so it's a net,1680204442.172181,15:27:22
Wyatt,they're not know ill still pick it up might might cut outs some move the the other stuff said yeah and it this is something that the,1680204465.7373886,15:27:45
speaker3.0,there's no there's no cynical but it it freezes is fun too,1680204495.6514535,15:28:15
Lucas,yeah we,1680204496.0953746,15:28:16
speaker4.0,word by word,1680204511.5868547,15:28:31
Lucas,what did then it can't do speaker entire asian adopting were by word and can't tell different tornado,1680204513.1517563,15:28:33
speaker5.0,them,1680204513.4953725,15:28:33
Wyatt,on one line it can update that same line a do or do you saying that it has to be,1680204537.885793,15:28:57
speaker3.0,because it had asked,1680204538.523491,15:28:58
speaker4.0,the enough for the phrase to the other chairman what the speaker is young up and are your we if we both they are you know,1680204540.201369,15:29:00
speaker3.0,show the words like immediately as a appear and that helps with monitor the is that five second like that have watched i watched the transcription on their what when this is done they'll be about a five second the way so it it's be performing at the same level is it there now now but then again this is a prototype so,1680204574.2088263,15:29:34
speaker3.0,the least at the bare minimum there's a problem,1680204595.5297341,15:29:55
Lucas,that,1680204595.9366796,15:29:55
speaker4.0,the it was your feedback,1680204596.6816866,15:29:56
speaker5.0,this you why thing about if it's listening or not,1680204597.6869655,15:29:57
speaker3.0,yeah,1680204604.3789165,15:30:04
Lucas,that is why would i forget,1680204617.8519413,15:30:17
Wyatt,the the still learning what something,1680204618.87121,15:30:18
speaker3.0,with his knees it happens as yeah so the mana using as late as soon as i mean,1680204650.765722,15:30:50
speaker4.0,did it did as very few samples that is that it using oh namely this is just for testing like,1680204652.3127055,15:30:52
speaker3.0,matters but you have for this it was just i can do you know hundreds of test on something day,1680204669.7524483,15:31:09
speaker3.0,extend the amount of,1680204679.8871412,15:31:19
speaker4.0,the time it takes is that so,1680204680.7980282,15:31:20
speaker3.0,how,1680204703.9884162,15:31:43
speaker4.0,actually the wrapping text would work with the implementation i have because this this thing is separated by a it's like git this the leaders what i'm thinking,1680204706.4780507,15:31:46
speaker3.0,the boss yeah a i can tell from the string that if the if it's going to be bigger than the with the box and then i could then just split it and then insert the rest on another mine,1680204727.1311479,15:32:07
speaker3.0,would i read the speaker underneath that line blank to show that the tintin continuation of that,1680204743.2254083,15:32:23
speaker3.0,is there it's,1680204750.353313,15:32:30
Wyatt,the is i watched have a single box and just have it with a pipe to break it up and then when you go to edited it has the whole option there you could change the name you could change the time and change the tax and you just,1680204774.3109221,15:32:54
speaker4.0,these regular expression,1680204775.0451233,15:32:55
Wyatt,check out the pipe,1680204775.7728765,15:32:55
speaker3.0,what are you tired,1680204795.5316415,15:33:15
Lucas,that's what i'm talking about,1680204796.3006911,15:33:16
speaker3.0,the the data structure for like how you want their this strings to be presented to the,1680204797.5319772,15:33:17
Lucas,what i'm saying you could technically have this is one big thing,1680204798.5398254,15:33:18
speaker3.0,and i mean you can i have names as at time or what whatever at i mean you you have to be all the parse out that been,1680204822.549131,15:33:42
speaker4.0,the it,1680204822.9744139,15:33:42
speaker3.0,that might be easier than worrying about those things being connected ah,1680204824.006922,15:33:44
speaker3.0,the this is your cp you write up a gear with,1680204849.1908894,15:34:09
speaker4.0,the it is with people use,1680204857.7622175,15:34:17
speaker3.0,the first team a good fit for someone probably get a to list,1680204936.701814,15:35:36
speaker3.0,the way files every time we are doing a new line,1680204965.0352817,15:36:05
speaker4.0,that know but ah,1680204965.5609546,15:36:05
speaker5.0,i am writing the way files every time brave that generate new line mom,1680204966.7079582,15:36:06
speaker3.0,the one from the growth of,1680204973.3505478,15:36:13
Wyatt,there,1680204973.7687469,15:36:13
speaker3.0,as you can see,1680204990.886021,15:36:30
speaker3.0,the time,1680204997.4226127,15:36:37
Lucas,so he was still good progress it wasn't it is not a good evening i'm disturbed with it is good is much mostly steeped in order for this one took up to a different your says he's on with of the day,1680205022.827882,15:37:02
speaker3.0,you can see this it was on would have to chinese in different devices mean didn't grow foreign is it was just one hundred sixty three different really today,1680205039.824785,15:37:19
speaker3.0,the third just complete my sense one okay okay the cat and the,1680205063.8279197,15:37:43
speaker4.0,dog went to the store,1680205064.6366305,15:37:44
speaker3.0,yeah i get it did it just completes the senate's it doesn't detect as asian,1680205065.8375463,15:37:45
Wyatt,obama think what that the as i was curious on that,1680205066.9557154,15:37:46
speaker3.0,about the fact that of me see a strain on us but it's not able to detect us correctly very often,1680205090.6538637,15:38:10
speaker4.0,that's it's not trained on us though at the just as is it has two instances of that not really trained,1680205092.2442904,15:38:12
speaker3.0,yeah i mean that,1680205092.7762992,15:38:12
speaker3.0,that slot right but but the thing is is we're supposed to be showing that it actually has no progress so you're from putting in wyatt i'm clicking here then it will identify that so,1680205116.6803157,15:38:36
Lucas,that that somebody who's to be,1680205117.8636806,15:38:37
speaker3.0,the correct it incident it will take me when i make that change it will then insert that back in into than instead of to for me will have three things enemy ah,1680205141.3415656,15:39:01
Wyatt,the church take that much to to train at i think when you get about the of six to ten,1680205142.6634905,15:39:02
Wyatt,going to be would,1680205153.3729768,15:39:13
speaker3.0,we've we've just had,1680205153.9371696,15:39:13
Wyatt,using a different microphone in this one get just so like this is the very initial state will be set more trying data but we have we don't throw it in for this prototype presentation because we don't have to be identifying every single one,1680205176.7021606,15:39:36
speaker3.0,the,1680205177.16338,15:39:37
speaker4.0,okay,1680205177.644745,15:39:37
speaker3.0,the didn't get in the could offer,1680205203.9441562,15:40:03
speaker4.0,oh great she was probably going okay,1680205204.8075426,15:40:04
speaker3.0,use some virtual machine with better,1680205223.124203,15:40:23
speaker3.0,it's bowl for a person on their laptop,1680205246.0410903,15:40:46
speaker4.0,but later that the thing is is that,1680205247.1152325,15:40:47
speaker3.0,if we're tying in we can't necessarily i i i think than the transfer of i mean depends on where the machine is obviously it's in the building it's not big deal but,1680205249.1266825,15:40:49
speaker3.0,starting more more latency as you do more more interaction yeah,1680205272.117117,15:41:12
speaker4.0,the i guess the though,1680205272.7681248,15:41:12
speaker5.0,reason why would need to local as for specifically all those way files that either,1680205274.0800567,15:41:14
Lucas,yet and keep my like that this rural areas and single microphone here,1680205275.2477043,15:41:15
speaker3.0,but,1680205288.4352667,15:41:28
speaker4.0,which will actually make paradise easier is which might go to coming from well that's probably someone different,1680205290.027302,15:41:30
speaker5.0,yeah ha,1680205290.6111739,15:41:30
Lucas,it,1680205297.0401547,15:41:37
speaker3.0,the are all that will go together,1680205305.0878942,15:41:45
speaker3.0,this is where i'm thinking is the fact that so on your laptop you can only use this like light speech to text a model,1680205322.581957,15:42:02
speaker3.0,oh you know what would we can tie run into google i already have this like,1680205345.830073,15:42:25
speaker3.0,this is for doing speaker dollars action over the the that there's nothing stops me from using a different model that the the little a framework so they can go around the model i have just chosen to use a model that that's local and can run and very small for it so why okay why,1680205370.1999826,15:42:50
speaker3.0,and then too,1680205392.1034153,15:43:12
speaker3.0,mesenteric is based on the model if you think that to fit with,1680205415.4008577,15:43:35
